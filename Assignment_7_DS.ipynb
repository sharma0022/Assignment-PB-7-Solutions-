    "Q.2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Raw strings are often used in regular expression objects to ensure that special characters,      such as backslashes, are treated as literal characters rather than as escape characters. In      regular expressions, backslashes are used to indicate special sequences, such as the start        of a new line or a specific character group. By using a raw string, the backslash character      is not treated as an escape character, which allows the regular expression to match on the        actual backslash character rather than on a special sequence."

A match object contains information about the match,          including the starting and ending position of the match within the searched string, as well      as any subgroups that were captured as part of the match."
